Babble [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tjarratt/babble.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tjarratt/babble)
=========

Babble is a small utility that generates random words for you. I found this useful because occasionally you need a random word for testing.

Dependencies
------------
On Unix/Linux this library makes uses the contents of `/usr/share/dict/words`. If this file is not present (e.g. in a Docker container) it can be populated by using the OS's package manager to install `wbritish` or `wamerican` 

Usage
-----

```go
package your_app

import (
  "github.com/tjarratt/babble"
)

func main() {
  babbler := babble.NewBabbler()
  println(babbler.Babble()) // excessive-yak-shaving (or some other phrase)

  // optionally set your own separator
  babbler.Separator = " "
  println(babbler.Babble()) // "hello from nowhere" (or some other phrase)

  // optionally set the number of words you want
  babbler.Count = 1
  println(babbler.Babble()) // antibiomicrobrial (or some other word)

  return
}
```
